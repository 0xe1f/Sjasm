# Sjasm #

Sjasm is a Z80 assembler developed by Sjoerd Mastijn. It is available to download, sources included, at [XL2S Entertainment site](http://home.online.nl/~smastijn/home.html).

This repository has been created from the original sources as a means to have them properly organized and easily browseable, it contains a Visual Studio solution holding a Visual C++ project with the sources themselves and a test project.

Two branches are available for the two versions of the program, they have been created from versions 0.39g6 and 0.42c. Switch to one of these branches to actually see code.

The documentation for v0.39 is in [a text file together with the source](https://bitbucket.org/konamiman/sjasm/src/v0.39/README.txt). Documentation for v0.42 [is available online](http://home.online.nl/~smastijn/sjasmmanual.html).

Enjoy!
